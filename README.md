## Project Structure

- All code files are located in the `code` folder.
- File names are numbered and/or named according to the order of the analysis.

The code relies heavily on data from the [Babase database](https://papio.biology.duke.edu/babasewiki/).  
Access to Babase data requires permission â€” please contact the corresponding author.

A selection of final datasets is publicly available at:  
[https://zenodo.org/records/14590285](https://zenodo.org/records/14590285)  
(*Note: Public data has been anonymized. The key to original names is available upon request.*)
